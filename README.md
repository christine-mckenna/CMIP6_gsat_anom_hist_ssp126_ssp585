# CMIP6_gsat_anom_hist_ssp126_ssp585
Time-series of global surface air temperature anomaly data for the CMIP6 historical, SSP1-2.6, and SSP5-8.5 simulations. The data for each model is the model ensemble mean, and anomalies are calculated with respect to the relevant model's pre-industrial control simulation.
