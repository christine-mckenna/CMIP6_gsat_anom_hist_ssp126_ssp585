# CMIP6_gsat_data
Time-series of annual global surface air temperature anomaly data for the CMIP6 historical, SSP1-2.6, and SSP5-8.5 simulations. The data for each model is the model ensemble mean, and anomalies are calculated with respect to the relevant model's pre-industrial control simulation.

The data in this repository was processed as part of the EU-funded CONSTRAIN project and this project should acknowledged by all users of this data. Processing was carried out on JASMIN from the raw CMIP6 data stored in /badc/cmip6. The current models in the dataset are all the models currently available on JASMIN as of 04/11/2019. Masked data is indicated by a value of 999999.
